# Programming Fundamentals with Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and large ecosystem of libraries. It is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more.

## Variables and Data Types
Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a type explicitly.


### Examples of basic data types
```python
name = "Alice"       # string
age = 30             # integer
height = 1.65        # float
is_active = True     # boolean
```

### Common data types:
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `float`: Decimal numbers
- `str`: Text (strings)
- `bool`: Boolean (True or False)
- `list, tuple, dict, set`: Collection types


## Control Flow
Python uses indentation (usually 4 spaces) to define code blocks.

```python
### If-else statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

### Elif (else-if) example
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C")
```

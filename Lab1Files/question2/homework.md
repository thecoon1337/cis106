# Markdown

## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a *lightweight markup language* that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 
Created *by John Gruber in 2004*, **Markdown** is now one of the world’s most popular markup language. 
Using **Markdown** is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. **Markdown** isn’t like that. When you create a **Markdown**-formatted file, you add **Markdown** syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

### Why Use Markdown?

**Markdown** can be used for everything. People use it to create ***websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.***

**Markdown** is portable. Files containing **Markdown**-formatted text can be ***opened using virtually any application.*** 

**Markdown** is platform independent. You can create **Markdown**-formatted text on ***any device running any operating system.***

**Markdown** is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your **Markdown**-formatted text using a text editing application. 

**Markdown** is everywhere. *Websites like Reddit and GitHub support **Markdown***, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.
